          Like the 964, 993 and 996, the 911 of the 997 series is also available
          with all-wheel drive in the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S. A new addition
          is the Carrera 4 GTS, which offers higher performance. In this series,
          the 911 Targa is only available with all-wheel drive as the Targa 4
          and 4S â€” a novelty in the 911 series.
